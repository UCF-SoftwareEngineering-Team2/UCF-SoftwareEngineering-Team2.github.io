## Issue Reporting/Tracking

In the event of a test discovering one or multiple error(s) during its automated run, the developer running the test must **log relevant test information** such as test type/purpose, where/how it failed, and if possible, provide insight as to the potential cause of the error or solution that will prevent the test from failing in the future.

After the test failure has been logged, the developer may only continue testing if error implication has been assessed, or if he thinks he can fix the problem himself, he may transition into the code, attempting to debug the code.

At any point in which a developer believes he has fixed an issue that has been logged by a failed test case, that developer should re-run the tests that caused the failed entry, and if the test passes, the developer should mark the associated failed test case as fixed for all other members to see, with a brief summary of what was done to fix the problem.



------------------------------



## Stopping Criteria

Errors discovered during the testing procedure may or may not render other further test cases obsolete. For example, if test case for verifying database connection were to fail, it would not be practical to test cases which involve database operations; therefore, the test procedure will stop. On the other hand, failure of the test case checking if events are viewable to other users does not constitute stopping test procedures checking if a user is able to create an event. Once an error has been identified, its implications must be assessed before a decision to halt testing can be made.

Unit/Integration Testing and System Testing procedures of the V-Model can be administered in two stages for a comprehensive testing procedure. The first stage is the functionality test which will use the set of "expected inputs/actions" as the inputs provided to the unit and/or system, whose response will be checked against the "expected response" to decide if the test case have passed or failed. Failure of a System Test will entail verification of System Design, while Unit/Integration Test failure entail verification of Program Design. 

If no test cases fail, we can further execute a second stage of exception testing by providing "unexpected or unlikely inputs/actions" as inputs to the unit and/or system. If an expected response to such an input has been established (exception handling implemented), it can be used determine a failure or pass of the test case; otherwise, the response is logged and reviewed for determining potential vulnerabilities (security) or flaws that can be addressed to improve stability and reliability of the application.

Tests should be functionally comprehensive, meaning they should conclusively determine the functional state of the project. In the case that no tests fail during a comprehensive test of the system, the developer should feel confident that the program is fully functional. Though this is a positive result, it does not imply that the work is done. A functional system test can not go through the application and look for design "bugs" or implementation failures. Following a successful run of tests, the developer should continue to look through the application for any cosmetic issues. If a design issue is found, it should be documented the same as other failures of the system.

Any live or production version of the software should comply with the following standards:
- All core features from the "Must Have" section of "The Proposed System: Operational Features" must completely pass all tests and be fully functional. [see Concepts of Operations] 
- All core "Must Have" features should have a user friendly interface and easily accessible by the implemented interface of the system.
- Any "Would Like to Have" features from the "Concepts of Operations" document must either be implemented fully and available to the user, or not included in the production version until they are complete, tested, and fully functioning.
- Known cosmetic and design flaws may be included in live versions of the application if they do not interfere with ANY feature of that production version. Also, design flaws should only be left in cases where they are trivial by nature and unnoticeable to the average user. Any known design implementation failure which is deemed obviously incorrect should be corrected before moving to the software's production version. 

If at any point, an unknown bug is found on the production version, the site should be updated at the next available designated maintenance time. If a severe bug is found on the production version of the software, the site should be replaced with the last known running version and the found bug should be fixed and the changes should be updated to production after extensive testing at the next available designated maintenance time.
