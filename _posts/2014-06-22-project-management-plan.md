## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a web application which allows users to find other users within the UCF campus community interested in organizing and playing sports on the various courts and fields of the UCF campus.  Users can schedule games, find people, and get notifications when a new game is created. This allows people on campus to play a pickup game whenever their schedule permits it.  This web application aims to make finding pickup games on campus for various sporting events an easy process.

## Configuration Management

We will be using Git version control protocol through a GitHub Organization account, which all members have read/write access to, for managing the source code to the application. All team members on the team will make contributions to the project by creating a branch from the master branch (ie make a copy of the master copy of the source code) of the repository and making changes to it (“committing” at every minor milestone) to implement required features of the application.  

When a team member believes that the copy of their code is good enough to become part of the master copy (merge), they will have to submit a “pull request” through the GitHub application.  Peers will see this “pull request” and accept it through the GitHub application where it is then available for testing on the peer’s computer.  The peers will test/review the team member’s code and upon agreement between members, the copy will be “merged” into the master branch.  Bug reports can be filed and documented through the GitHub website.  Resolution to the bugs can also be filed through the site as well.

Using this system, all aspects of source code management history will be self documenting, and any catastrophic additions to the project source code can be reverted and averted.  


----------------------------

## Quality Assurance
- The team will perform stress testing on each unit of code that is meant to perform a particular purpose as each deliverable is released. Patrick Delva will perform all testing.

----------------------------

## Risk Management
- Time Management 
	- Beforehand scheduling 
- Completion of Tasks
	- Prioritization based on criticality of functionality

## Plan for tracking, control, and reporting of progress

Each Thursday a meeting between group members will take place to discuss group individual goals and progress towards each phase. Meeting notes and length will be collected and given to the Project Manager. This will be done for purposes of preparing a project management report which will be delivered to the team privately for the checking of project status and progress. 

Monthly, all developers will provide a technical document describing their progress of their work packages for metric data and milestone confirmation. QA assessment will be done with each project release and will contain stress tests for all modules within the code as decided by the lead developer. Reports will be handled through the completion of phase documents and their submission to the professor and TA.
